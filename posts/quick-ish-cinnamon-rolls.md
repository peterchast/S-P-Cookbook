instructions:
  - title: Mix the dry ingredients
    description: "Combine in mixing bowl: flower, sugar, salt, yeast. Attach the
      kneading hook to the mixer."
  - title: Prep the liquids
    description: "Combine in measuring cup: hot water, milk, and butter. Stir until
      butter is fully melted."
  - title: Combine it all
    description: Add the warm water mixture to the dry ingredients. Mix together.
      Add egg and continue kneading together until dough is no longer sticky
      (3-4 min.).
  - title: Resting time
    description: Remove the dough ball from the mixing bowl with one hand and spray
      the inside of the mixing bowl with light coat of oil. Return dough ball to
      bowl and let rest for 5 min.
  - title: Roll it out
    description: Roll into a 15 x 9“ rectangle
  - title: Make the filling
    description: Combine the softened butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon.
  - title: Preheat the oven to 200°F
    description: Pretty self-explanatory. See above.
  - title: Fill it up!
    description: Spread the filling evenly across the dough rectangle.
  - title: Roll it up!
    description: Roll the dough hamburger style (tightly!) then cut into nine rolls.
      Consider using unflavored dental floss for a more even cut.
  - title: Put them in a greasy pan
    description: Grease a 9 inch round or square pan and put the rolls in. Grease a
      piece of foil and cover the pan with it.
  - title: I need proof! (20 min)
    description: Turn off the oven and proof for 20 min.
  - title: Remove foil and bake!
    description: Remove foil and increase temperature to  375°F for 12-15 min (until
      golden brow). As they bake, prep the frosting (for now use the link at the
      bottom; Someday I will add instructions here)
other_notes:
  - note: "This can also be used as a king cake recipe if you break the dough into 3
      strips before adding the filling. Roll each strip longways after putting
      the filling, then braid strips together and make a circle. After baking,
      add frosting as normal, then top with purple, green, and gold sugar in an
      alternating pattern and hide a small baby figuring inside. "
