other_notes:
  - note: "This can also be used as a king cake recipe if you break the dough into 3
      strips before adding the filling. Roll each strip longways after putting
      the filling, then braid strips together and make a circle. After baking,
      add frosting as normal, then top with purple, green, and gold sugar in an
      alternating pattern and hide a small baby figuring inside. "
