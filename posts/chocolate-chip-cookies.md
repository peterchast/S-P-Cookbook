    description: Press plastic wrap against the dough, and refrigerate for 24 to 36

  - title: Preheat to 350°F
    description: When you’re ready to bake, preheat oven to 350°F (325°F if frozen).
      Remove the bowl of dough from the refrigerator, and allow it to soften
      slightly. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking
      mat.
  - description: Using a standard-size ice cream scoop – about 1/3 cup – scoop six
      mounds of dough onto the baking sheet, making sure to space them evenly.
      Sprinkle lightly with sea salt.
    title: Scoop & sprinkle with salt
  - description: >-
      Bake until golden brown but still soft, 15 to 20 minutes (Scotia says 17
      minutes For our oven, 13 min for the toaster oven). Transfer the baking
      sheet to a wire rack for 10 minutes, then transfer the cookies onto the
      rack to cool a bit more.


      Repeat with the remaining dough.


      \* If baking from frozen, we’re still figuring out the timing but try 20 minutes for now.
