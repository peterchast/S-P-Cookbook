  Peter has strong opinions about quiche (he doesn't like it). But he quite
  enjoys *this* quiche. Probably because there is only a thin top layer of
  actual quiche-y consistency, while the bottom is pure spinachy, mushroomy,
  cheesy goodness. 


  Scotia likes to get double the ingredients and then make this recipe twice in a row so she has one quiche to eat and one to freeze for later.

      You can do the math yourself.

      Steam the spinach and squeeze out moisture. Set aside.

  - description: Place sautéed veggies, spinach, and shredded cheese into the bottom
      of the pie shell. Pour egg mixture on top (should pretty much cover it—can
      add more milk or egg if it doesn't).
    title: Build the quiche
