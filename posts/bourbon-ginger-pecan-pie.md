instructions:
  - description: To make the dough, mix the flour, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a
      food processor, or in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.
      (The dough can also be made by hand, in a bowl with a pastry blender, or
      using your hands.) Add the chilled butter and mix or pulse the dough until
      the butter is broken up into small pieces about the size of peas.
    title: Mix the dough
  - description: Add 3 tablespoons of ice water and mix until the dough begins to
      come together. If necessary, add 1 more tablespoon of water if the dough
      needs it to come together. Turn the dough out on a work surface and give
      it a few turns with your hands. Shape the dough into a disk, wrap in
      plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
    title: Mix the dough more (and shape)
  - description: Roll the dough on a lightly floured surface, or between two pieces
      of parchment paper until it’s about 13-inches (33cm) in diameter. Brush
      off any excess flour and transfer it to a 9-inch (23cm) pie plate or pan.
      Tuck the overhanging edges under, between the rim of the pie plate and the
      dough, and crimp the edge of the dough. Chill the dough in the
      refrigerator until firm.
    title: Roll out the dough / Pre-heat oven to 375ºF
  - description: To bake the pie dough, preheat the oven to 375ºF (190ºC). Prick the
      pie dough a few times with a fork. Line the pie dough with aluminum foil
      and fill halfway with beans, rice, or pie weights. Bake until the dough is
      set and starting to get lightly golden brown, about 15 to 20 minutes. Lift
      out the foil with the weights and bake until the dough is well-browned,
      about 5 to 8 minutes more. Turn the oven down to 350ºF (180ºC).
    title: Blind bake your crust
  - description: To make the filling, in a large bowl, whisk together the brown
      sugar, maple syrup, eggs, melted butter, bourbon, fresh ginger, ground
      ginger, vanilla, and salt. Stir in the pecans and candied ginger.
    title: Mix the filling
  - description: Pour the filling into the prebaked tart shell and bake until the
      center of the pie is seems just about set. It should still jiggle a
      little. Begin checking it at the 40 minute mark, but it may take 45 to 50
      minutes to reach that point of doneness. Remove it from the oven and let
      cool on a wire rack.
