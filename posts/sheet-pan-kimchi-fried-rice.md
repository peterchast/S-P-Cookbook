story: This is a great fired rice option when you don't have day old rice to
  crumble into a wok. It's pretty easy to make, packed with flavor, and the
  baked eggs are a beautiful touch.

instructions:
  - title: Cook the rice
    description: Cook the rice however you normally do. This isn't a rice cooking recipe.
  - title: Preheat to 450Â°F
    description: Position a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 425 degrees
  - title: Whisk together sauce
    description: In a large bowl, whisk together the sesame oil, gochujang, kimchi
      juice, soy sauce and sugar. Season generously with salt.
  - title: Incorporate chunky stuff
    description: Stir in the chopped kimchi and onion. Then add the cooked rice,
      butter and seaweed and stir to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning with
      salt.
  - title: Bake for 25-30 minutes
    description: Transfer the rice mixture to a large rimmed sheet pan and spread
      out loosely. Bake until the top of the rice is crispy and chewy but not
      burned, 25 to 30 minutes, opening the oven door halfway through (to check
      on it, but also to let excess moisture out during the cooking).
  - title: Finish with eggs
    description: Remove the pan from the oven. Using a spoon, create 6 shallow
      depressions in the rice. Crack the eggs into the depressions and place the
      pan back in the oven until the egg whites have just set, 3 to 6 minutes.
      Serve immediately, while the eggs are still runny.
