  The New York Times puts together a mean fried rice! Adding cabbage is a stroke
  of genius because it basically disappears into the dish. 


  Their technique differs a bit from what I'm used to, with the egg fried separately and place on top. Or you could try it Kaimuki Superette style and poach your egg.


  I've removed all mentions of bacon from this recipe, but NYT calls for 3 slices of thick-cut bacon, chopped up, cooked in the pan before everything else, removed, and then folded in with everything else later.

instructions:
  - description: >-
      In a large nonstick skillet or wok over medium-high, heat 2 tablespoons
      oil until  it shimmers and dances around the pan. Add scallion whites to
      the pan. Cook until soft, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes. If the pan
      looks dry, drizzle in a little more oil, then stir in cabbage and a pinch
      of salt. 


      Cook, continuing to stir frequently, until cabbage is soft, 2 to 4 minutes. Stir in garlic, and cook until fragrant, another 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a heatproof bowl.

  - description: >-
      Add remaining 3 tablespoons oil to skillet and raise heat to high. Add
      rice, and a large pinch of salt, then toss thoroughly to coat with oil.
      Spread out rice in an even layer along the bottom (and sides if in a wok),
      and drizzle fish sauce and soy sauce over. 


      Let rice sit until sizzling stops and it starts to crackle and crisp, 1 to 4 minutes. Toss, taste, and add more fish sauce or soy sauce if necessary.
    title: Fry the rice
  - description: Fold in cabbage mixture, kimchi and peas, then transfer to plates.
      Top with scallion greens, more kimchi to taste, and fried eggs, if using.
      Drizzle everything with sesame oil and soy sauce, if you like, and serve
      immediately.
