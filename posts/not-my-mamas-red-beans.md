story: >-
  My mom always made red beans when I was growing up. At least once a week, but
  it seemed like more. It was never my favorite, and once I became a vegetarian
  I couldn't even have it anymore. Then COVID came and I got assigned to make a
  weekly meal for our household and I wanted an easy go-to that made me feel a
  connection to home in New Orleans and this fit the bill perfectly. I even
  insisted that my night be Mondays to match the New Orleans tradition of slow
  cooking beans all day on laundry day.


  HOWEVER, my mom would certainly not approve of this recipe:


  1. Red Beans should never be made from a can, they must be soaked all night long, then simmered in a slow cooker all day.

  2. Meat is essential to red beans and rice. Layer upon layer of flavor means that multiple types of meat are key.

  3. That's pretty much it, but this list needed a third thing, so let's say she wouldn't ever use any color pepper but green and I frequently do!

instructions:
  - title: "Ask Peter to start the rice. "
    description: We use an Instant pot (and in case Scotia has to do it, it's a 1:1
      ratio, 4 minutes on pressure cook, don't forget to give it a stir!), but
      you can cook it however you prefer to cook rice.

        unit: cups
        ingredient: water
  - title: Simmer the holy trinity.
    description: Add vegetable oil to large stock pot on medium heat. Once it heats
      up a bit, add the Holy Trinity (see tip). Then add garlic and other
      spices. Turn the heat down to medium low, and let simmer for 5-20 minutes
      (until slightly browned and everyone who enters the room says ‘that smells
      delicious’).
    instruction_tip:
      - description: When I include the holy trinity, I usually chop the onion first,
          and add it to the pot, then chop the celery and add it to the pot, and
          last chop the bell pepper and add it to the pot. This way the onion is
          cooking the longest and the bell pepper the least.

    instruction_tip:
      - title: How to know when you've used enough Cajun Seasoning.
        description: >-
          Firstly, when using Cajun Seasoning, I prefer Tony Chachare’s, or
          'Tony's' as this is a household staple in New Orleans. As a general
          rule, if using full sodium beans, use less Tony's as it tends to be
          full of salt. Consider the spice level that you can handle and put in
          slightly less than that so that you can add more Tony's on top of your
          dish when serving.


          Once you add the beans, taste test to see if more Tony's is warranted.


          Don't skimp on the Tony's.
  - title: Time for broth and beans.
    description: >-
      Pour in a splash of vegetable broth, then add all the beans. Then fill
      with more vegetable broth until slightly more liquidy than you want your
      final product. Simmer the beans for at least alf an hour while stirring
      occasionally. Add more spices or vegetable broth, as needed.


      As the beans cook and simmer, use a wooden spoon to smash them against the side of the pot, especially if substituting regular beans rather than the can of creole red beans.

    description: In bowls, add spoonful of rice, top with beans, and add a sprinkle
      of green onions (to everyone's bowl but mine). Serve and don't forget to
      put the Tony's and Jamajang on the table to add spice. Enjoy!
