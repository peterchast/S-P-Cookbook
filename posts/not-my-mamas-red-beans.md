story: >-
  My mom always made red beans when I was growing up. At least once a week, but
  it seemed like more. It was never my favorite, and once I became a vegetarian
  I couldn't even have it anymore. Then COVID came and I got assigned to make a
  weekly meal for our household and I wanted an easy go-to that made me feel a
  connection to home in New Orleans and this fit the bill perfectly. I even
  insisted that my night be Mondays to match the New Orleans tradition of slow
  cooking beans all day on laundry day.


  HOWEVER, my mom would certainly not approve of this recipe:


  1. Red Beans should never be made from a can, they must be soaked all night long, then simmered in a slow cooker all day.

  2. Meat is essential to red beans and rice. Layer upon layer of flavor means that multiple types of meat are key.

  3. That's pretty much it, but this list needed a third thing, so let's say she wouldn't ever use any color pepper but green and I frequently do!

    description: We use an Instant pot (and in case Scotia has to do it, it's a 1:1
      ratio, 4 minutes on pressure cook, don't forget to give it a stir!), but
      you can cook it however you prefer to cook rice.

        ingredient: rice
      - amount: "2 "
        unit: cups
        ingredient: water
  - title: Simmer the holy trinity.
    description: Add vegetable oil to large stock pot on medium heat. Once it heats
      up a bit, add the Holy Trinity (see tip). Then add garlic and other
      spices. Turn the heat down to medium low, and let simmer for 5-20 minutes
      (until slightly browned and everyone who enters the room says ‘that smells
      delicious’).
    instruction_tip:
      - description: When I include the holy trinity, I usually chop the onion first,
          and add it to the pot, then chop the celery and add it to the pot, and
          last chop the bell pepper and add it to the pot. This way the onion is
          cooking the longest and the bell pepper the least.
