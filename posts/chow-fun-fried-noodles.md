story: Eat this 15-minute meal for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! It's easy and
  foolproof. Also, don't bother reading these instructions. It's best to pick up
  the technique by [watching the pros do it in this
  video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbauWTD1OXk). Gordon Ramsay does a
  [pretty good version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhsN_36OW4w) too.

instructions:
  - title: Prepare all the ingredients
    description: >-
      Stir-frying goes fast. It's best to have everything prepped before hand.
      Noodles boiled (if dry). Vegetables chopped/sliced/julienned. Sauce
      ingredients combined and whisked.


      If you're using hard vegetables like broccoli, you should probably give them a blanch to soften them up.
  - title: Prepare the pan
    description: >-
      Start heating your pan on the burner. It's easiest to use something
      non-stick or well-seasoned carbon steel. Woks offer optimum flipability. 


      Add a few tablespoons of cooking oil and wait for it to shimmer.
  - title: Drop the proteins
    description: Cook your proteins first. If you are using eggs, you should drop
      them at the very end of this step.
  - title: Drop the veggies
    description: You can mix them straight in with your proteins and continue cooking.
  - title: Add the noodles
    description: >-
      Once the proteins are cooked through and the veggies are softened, throw
      the noodles on top and give the pan a few strong tosses to mix (or stirs
      if you don't have the toss technique down).


      If you don't have the pan on screaming high heat, sit everything sit flat for a minute.
  - title: Add the sauce and toss
    description: >-
      Drizzle a several spoonfuls of sauce over the mixture. You want just
      enough to coat the noodles, not drown them. You can continue adding more
      sauce as you cook..


      Give the noodles a stir, whack up the heat (if it isn't all the way up), and then continue to toss/stir everything as the edges crisp and the surfaces brown.
  - title: Garnish now or later
    description: I usually add my garnishes and mix them into the noodles in the
      pan. But, if you're going for a fancy presentation, you should garnish
      after you plate.
