  This recipe was optimized for challah ([1/2 of the dough from this
  recipe](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/classic-challah-recipe))
  cooked in my 1 lb loaf pan. My trick is to overproof the dough until it's
  nearly mushrooming over the rim, and then give it a bake. The next day (or the
  day after that), the loaf is perfect for eight, thick, custardy slices of
  French toast. 


  *IMPORTANT:* If your bread is already pretty stale, you can skip the first two steps.

instructions:
  - title: Heat oven to 300°F
    description: "Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 300°F. If
      your bread is already nice and stale, you can skip this step and the next.
      "
  - description: Fit a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet. Place the bread in a
      single layer on the rack. Bake, flipping halfway through, until dry to the
      touch on both sides, about 15 minutes total. Remove from oven and let cool
      5 minutes. Meanwhile, make the custard.
    title: Dry out the bread
  - description: >-
      Place the milk or cream, eggs, maple syrup, vanilla, and cinnamon in a
      mixing bowl and whisk until fully combined (no streaks of egg remaining).
      Pour into a 9x13-inch baking dish.


      You can also dump all the ingredients straight into the baking dish, but it'll be more difficult to get a thorough mixing.
    title: Mix up the custard
  - description: Add as many slices of challah as can fit in a single layer. Soak,
      flipping once, until drenched but not falling apart, 1 to 2 minutes per
      side. Return to wire rack (letting excess drip off into baking sheet) and
      repeat with remaining challah slices.
    title: Soak the bread
  - description: >-
      Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium
      heat. When the foaming subsides and the butter is sizzling but not brown,
      add 4 soaked challah slices.


      Cook until the bottoms are golden-brown and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until the second side is browned, about 3 minutes more. Add remaining 1 tablespoon butter to the pan in between batches, swirling as it melts to ensure it doesn’t burn. Serve warm with more maple syrup.
